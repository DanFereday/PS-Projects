# Powershell Projects and Excercises



Simple Network Troubleshooting Tool -


  A powershell function designed to assist help desk personnel in diagnosing network connectivity issues on 
  end user machines by proving the users with an easy-to-use menu system for running common commands.
  Recommended use - install this function in the powershell profile of your organization's production
  Windows image in order to allow end users to call it from Powershell with no installation.






Random Password Generator -


  Randomly generates 12 to 60-character passwords containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers,  
  and special characters.  Creates a unique salt for every password randomization to reduce the liklihood of
  the same pasword being generated more than once.

  Accepts a .csv export of a ServiceNow report, isolates the contents of a specified column of the CSV, randomly
  selects a designated percentage of those items, prints them to the screen, then allows the user to export them
  to a designated output file along with a timestamp.  Appends to the file if multiple exports are run on the
  same file.
